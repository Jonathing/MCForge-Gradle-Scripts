# PowerShell Scripts

These were created to be an alternative to the cmd Scripts already present in the repository. Scripts for Visual Studio Code coming soon.

## How to Run

### Windows PowerShell

On Windows, right click the `.ps1` file and click on `Run with PowerShell`.

### PowerShell Core

To those who are confused as to what PowerShell Core is, it is Microsoft's updated version of PowerShell which is now available crossplatform for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
To run one of the script in PowerShell Core, simply run it in the PowerShell Core console. For example, to run the `Build Blue Skies.ps1` script, I would enter `& './Build Blue Skies.ps1'` and press ENTER.
