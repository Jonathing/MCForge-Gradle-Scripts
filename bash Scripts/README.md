# Unix bash Scripts

These were created to make doing certain gradle tasks in the repo much easier and more manageable. Scripts for Visual Studio Code coming soon.

## How to Run

### macOS and Linux

To run one of the scripts, simply run it in the terminal. For example, to run the `Build Blue Skies.sh` script, enter in `./Build\ Blue\ Skies.sh` and press ENTER. If for some reason your flavor of Linux doesn't have bash, please make sure you install it or run `./gradlew [task]` manually yourself.
