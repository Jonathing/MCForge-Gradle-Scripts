# Updating MCGradle Scripts

Ready to update MCGradle Scripts?

## Download Manually (Recommended)

To update MCGradle Scripts manually without using a Git submodule, go to https://github.com/Jonathing/MCGradle-Scripts/releases/ and download the latest `MCGradle-Scripts.zip` file! Delete the old version of MCGradle Scripts, then unzip the file as-is in your root project directory.

## Update via Git Submodules

To update the MCGradle Scripts submodule:

- Open your terminal of choice the submodule directory
- Run `git pull`
- Go back to the root project directory (`cd ..`)
- Run `git commit -a -m "Updated MCGradle Scripts`

If you are familiar with how to use a Git GUI, feel free to use that instead. Remember that official updates will always be on the `master` branch! If you feel like living on the edge, feel free to `git checkout develop` for experimental builds of MCGradle Scripts.
