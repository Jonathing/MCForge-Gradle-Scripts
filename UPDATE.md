# Updating MCGradle Scripts

Ready to update MCGradle Scripts?

## Download Manually (Recommended)

To update MCGradle Scripts manually without using a Git submodule, go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Jonathing/MCGradle-Scripts/releases/) and download the latest `MCGradle-Scripts.zip` file! Delete the old version of MCGradle Scripts, then unzip the file as-is in your root project directory.

## Update via Git Submodules

To update the MCGradle Scripts submodule:

- Open your terminal of choice your root project directory.
- Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

If you are familiar with how to use a Git GUI, feel free to use that instead. Remember that official updates will always be on the `master` branch! If you feel like living on the edge, feel free to `git checkout develop` for experimental builds of MCGradle Scripts.
