# Windows Command Prompt Batch Scripts

These were created to make doing certain gradle tasks in the repo much easier and more manageable. Scripts for Visual Studio Code coming soon.

## How to Run

On Windows, double click on the `.bat` file you want to run.  
These scripts use Windows Command Prompt, so naturally, they cannot be run on macOS or Linux.
